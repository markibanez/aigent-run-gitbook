# Introduction

aigent.run is an **AI agent terminal** built for the next generation of onchain interaction. Instead of navigating complex dashboards or decentralized exchanges, users can now simply **chat or speak directly with specialized AI agents** to get things done.

Whether buying a token, analyzing onchain data, or automating trading strategies, everything is streamlined into one intuitive terminal experience.

## Why the Pivot?

In our early stages, aigent.run offered a memecoin-focused DEX and launchpad. While these tools were powerful, they were still constrained by the **traditional “click-and-navigate” UX** of existing Web3 platforms.

Through constant development and user feedback, we discovered a more natural way:

* **Ask, don’t click.** Instead of hunting through interfaces, just type “Analyze liquidity for XRP/RLUSD” or “Buy 5000 aixrp using RLUSD”
* **Agents that adapt.** Tasks are executed by specialized AI agents equipped with MCP tools, chaining together complex actions automatically.
* **Everything in one place.** From token analysis to automated trading and blockchain exploration, the terminal becomes your universal command center.

## Vision

We believe conversational AI will replace dashboards as the primary way users interact with blockchains and digital ecosystems. Just as command lines transformed computing decades ago, the **AI Agent Terminal** is redefining how users control onchain activity.

With aigent.run, users gain:

* **Efficiency:** Reduce 10+ clicks into a single prompt.
* **Accessibility:** No technical skills required, if you can chat, you can use the terminal.
* **Adaptability:** Agents evolve with your workflows, learning from context and preferences.
* **Interoperability:** Built for the XRP Ledger, with more integrations coming.

### **Key Takeaway**

aigent.run is not another DEX or launchpad. It is a **terminal-first platform**, where **AI agents are the interface**. Faster, smarter, and more user-friendly than anything that came before.
