# MCP Tools

They are specialized modules that agents can call on to perform tasks, from analyzing liquidity to executing trades.

When you type or speak a request, your agent automatically selects the right MCP tools, chains them together if needed, and delivers the final result.

### **How MCP Tools Work**

1. **You make a request**: “Analyze aixrp/XRP liquidity and swap 200 XRP if slippage < 1%.”
2. **The agent selects tools**: liquidity analysis → slippage calculation → trade execution.
3. **The tools run in sequence** and return data.
4. **The agent interprets and confirms** the result in plain language.

You don’t need to know which tool to call, the agent handles the complexity.

### **Why MCP Tools Matter**

* **Automation**: Your agent handles repetitive steps.
* **Efficiency**: No more manual navigation across multiple dApps.
* **Scalability**: Complex workflows become a single command.
* **Adaptability**: Tools are modular — more will be added over time (NFTs, full social automation, and beyond).
