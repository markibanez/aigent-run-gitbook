# Using the AI Agent Terminal

The terminal is designed to feel natural. Instead of clicking through menus, you simply **type or speak commands**. The AI agent understands your intent, chooses the right tools, and executes the task.

Examples:

* “What are my Xaman balances right now?”
* “Swap 500 XRP into aixrp.”
* “Summarize today’s XRPL market trends.”
* “Analyze the current technical indicators around XRP”

### **Chat Input**

* The simplest way to use the terminal is through chat.
* Just type your request into the input box.
* The agent replies with confirmations, insights, or completed actions.

Chat input is ideal for:

* Quick balance checks.
* Market analysis.
* Blockchain exploration.
* Brainstorming up automated strategies.

### **Voice Input** _(soon)_

* You can also speak directly to your agent (where supported).
* Commands like “Buy XRP using whatever RLUSD I have in my Joey wallet” or “Read my Xaman wallet history” can be spoken just like normal conversation.
* The agent transcribes your request, confirms it, and executes.

Voice input is perfect for mobile or multitasking users who prefer hands-free control.
