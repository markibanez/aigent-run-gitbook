# Social Agents

Social Agents are specialized AI-driven accounts that can engage on behalf of your project across major platforms. They help you **automate community management, amplify your reach, and keep engagement consistent**.

Unlike trading agents in the terminal, **social agents are currently managed through our web UI**. This gives you a simple interface for connecting accounts, setting up behavior, and monitoring engagement.

### **Current Capabilities**

#### **Twitter/X Integration**

* Make posts directly from your agent.
* Automatically reply to mentions.
* Schedule recurring updates (e.g., daily stats).
* Amplify token launches and community news.

#### **Telegram & Discord**

* Agents will join your community chats.
* Answer FAQs, provide updates, and moderate discussions.
* Deliver scheduled content (e.g., token stats, event reminders).

### **Why Social Agents Matter**

* **Consistency**: Keep your community engaged 24/7.
* **Scalability**: Handle larger audiences without scaling your human team.
* **Personalization**: Agents can adopt specific tones and personalities to reflect your project’s brand.

### **How They Relate to the Terminal**

While social agents are currently managed through the UI, they are being built to **eventually connect seamlessly into the terminal**.\
This means in the near future you’ll be able to:

* Type in the terminal: _“Have my agent post daily updates on X.”_
* Or: _“Summarize our community sentiment from Telegram this week.”_

For now, setup and management are done via the UI, but all roads lead toward **a single command center in the terminal**.
