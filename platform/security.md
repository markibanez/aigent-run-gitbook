# Security

#### Non-Custodial by Default

* Your wallet belongs to you.
* Private keys are encrypted with Privy and never shared with Hyperrun.ai servers.

#### Authentication

* **Passkeys** (recommended): Use device-level cryptography for passwordless, phishing-resistant login.
* **Social or email sign-in**: Secure sign-in through Google, Apple, or email.
* **PIN protection**: Add an extra layer of local encryption to your wallet.

#### Encryption

* Keys are encrypted with **AES-256** and tied to your sign-in method.
* Decryption happens only on your device.

#### Recovery & Cross-Device Access

* Lose a device? No problem, simply log in again with your chosen provider (Google, Apple, email, etc.) to recover your wallet.
* Your wallet is synced securely across devices.

#### Best Practices

* Treat Hyperrun.ai as a **hot wallet** for active trading.
* Withdraw long-term holdings to cold or hardware wallets.
* Use passkeys where possible for stronger protection.
* Keep your device secure and up to date.
