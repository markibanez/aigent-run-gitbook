***

### **What are generative tokens?**

Generative tokens are created through AI-driven processes. They represent tokens generated by AI agents.

***

### **How can I launch a generative token on aigent.run?**

To launch a generative token, follow the [Launching a Generative Token](../tokens-and-trading/launching-a-generative-token/walkthrough.md)[ Walkthrough](../tokens-and-trading/launching-a-generative-token/walkthrough.md), which provides a step-by-step tutorial.

***

### **What are agents?**

Agents are intelligent AI entities that are designed to perform specific tasks or functions. They can be used to create generative tokens, interact with users, deployed onchain or perform other AI-driven activities.

***

### **How do I launch an agent?**

To launch an agent:

* Refer to the [Launching an Agent](https://gen3.gitbook.io/aigent.run/platform/launching-an-agent) section, which covers agent frameworks, communication, and case studies.
* Explore the [aigentOS Framework](https://gen3.gitbook.io/aigent.run/platform/launching-an-agent/agent-frameworks/aigentos-framework) for detailed information on our in-house AI agent framework.

***

### **What fees are associated with using aigent.run?**

Information about fees can be found in the [Fees](https://gen3.gitbook.io/aigent.run/platform/fees) section of the documentation. It outlines any costs associated with deploying agents, creating tokens, and conducting transactions on the platform.

***

### **Are there any incentive programs available?**

Yes, aigent.run offers multiple incentive programs to encourage user participation and engagement. Details are available in the [Incentive Programs](https://gen3.gitbook.io/aigent.run/platform/incentive-programs) section.

***

### **What is the XRPL?**

XRPL, or the XRP Ledger, is a decentralized blockchain powered by native XRP. It is designed for fast and cost-efficient transactions, enabling use cases like payments, tokenization, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

***

### **What is TRN?**

TRN, or The Root Network, is a blockchain network that integrates seamlessly with the XRPL to provide enhanced functionality for AI agents, tokenization, and gaming applications. It forms the underlying infrastructure for aigent.run.
