# FAQ

### **What is aigent.run?**

aigent.run is an **AI Agent Terminal,** a chat-based platform where you interact with blockchain and AI agents using simple commands.\
Instead of navigating complex dashboards or decentralized exchanges, you can just type or speak your request, and your agent handles it.

***

### **How is it different from a DEX or launchpad?**

Traditional DEXs require:

* Navigating a web app
* Connecting a wallet
* Finding the right pool or pair
* Manually analyzing data
* Executing a trade

With aigent.run:

* You simply say: **“Swap 500 RLUSD into XRP at the best rate.”**
* The agent does everything for you in seconds.

It’s **faster, simpler, and more accessible**.

***

### **Do I need to understand crypto wallets?**

No. When you create an account, aigent.run automatically generates a secure wallet in the background for you.\
You can:

* Use the **default auto-wallet** (with passkey or PIN login).
* Link an **external wallet** like Xaman or Joey for full control.
* Fund an **agent-managed wallet** for fully autonomous transactions.

You don’t need to manage keys manually unless you want to.

***

### **What chains are supported?**

Currently:

* **XRPL (XRP Ledger)**

Support for additional chains will be added as the terminal expands.

***

### **Are there any fees?**

* **Right now:** The terminal charges **no additional fees,** only the standard network transaction fees.
* **In the future:** Small fees may be introduced for premium features or advanced agent capabilities.

***

### **How secure is my account?**

Very secure. You can log in using:

* **Passkeys (recommended):** Device-based cryptography, phishing-resistant.
* **PINs:** Encrypts your private key locally (never shared).

Private keys are **never stored on our servers**.

***

### **Do I need technical skills to use it?**

Not at all. If you can chat, you can use the terminal.

* Beginners: Ask simple things like “Check my balance.”
* Advanced users: Automate strategies like “Sell 50% of my holdings if the price has dropped 20% or more over the last 7 days.”

***

### **What can I do in the terminal today?**

At launch, you can:

* Check balances and transaction history.
* Analyze liquidity pools and orderbooks.
* Estimate slippage and execute swaps.
* Run automated trading strategies.

More features (NFTs, Dapp integrations, advanced token analysis) are coming soon.

***

### **Do you have incentive programs?**

Yes, but they’re still being finalized.

* **runScore v2 (Coming Soon):** Earn points for using the terminal
* **Referrals v2 (Coming Soon):** Rewards for inviting active users.

***

### **Can I store my funds here long-term?**

No. aigent.run is designed as a **hot wallet interface**.

* Great for trading, analysis, and automation.
* Not recommended for long-term storage of large holdings.
* Always use cold or external wallets for major funds.
