# aigent Token

Aigent.run does not have a platform token. Instead, our focus is entirely on creating real value for the platform and its users—free from the volatility of token-driven development.\
\
Agent platforms with their own tokens often face pressure to prioritize developments that boost token value, which can detract from core goals and value for users. Most tokens in the crypto space struggle to maintain their value over time, which can negatively impact the projects they are tied to. When token prices drop, the platform’s perceived value often diminishes as well, regardless of its actual utility or progress. We are ensuring Aigent.run remains focused on delivering long-term value and stability, without being subjected to the volatility associated with an alt token-dependent platform. By choosing not to have a platform token, we safeguard the longevity of Aigent.run, staying true to our vision of delivering powerful and reliable functionality for our users.

All transactions are conducted using XRP or ROOT ensuring simplicity and liquidity. Asset bridging between the XRPL, Ethereum and TRN is seamless facilitated through our integrated bridge widget.
