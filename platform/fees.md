# Fees

### **Current Fees**

At launch, the AI Agent Terminal charges **no additional fees** on transactions.

* All swaps, trades, and actions you perform in the terminal cost only the standard network fees (XRPL transaction fees).
* There are no hidden charges or platform cuts.

### **Future Plans**

As the platform evolves, we may introduce small fees for certain advanced features or premium agent capabilities.

* Any future fees will be **transparent and clearly documented**.
* Core terminal functionality will remain accessible to all users.

### **Key Takeaway**

Right now, the terminal is **completely fee-free** beyond native blockchain costs, making it the most efficient way to trade, analyze, and interact onchain.
