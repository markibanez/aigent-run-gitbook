# Agent Frameworks

aigent.run integrates many of the top AI agent frameworks (like ElizaOS and ZerePy) to provide users with a comprehensive and seamless experience. By bridging these advanced frameworks with the XRP ecosystem for the first time, we aim to unlock unprecedented opportunities for innovation and utility.

aigent.run leverages established AI frameworks to ensure compatibility and access to powerful tools, enabling users to deploy highly capable and adaptable aigents. Simultaneously, we are developing our own proprietary AI agent framework. This lightweight and cost-efficient framework is designed to lower the barriers to entry. It focuses on optimizing resource usage while maintaining robust user-focused functionality.
