# First Commands in the Terminal

Getting started with Hyperrun.ai is easy. After you sign in and set up your wallet with Privy, you can immediately chat with your agent.

Here are some example commands to try:

* **Check balances**
  * “What’s my USDC balance?”
  * “Show me my BTC and ETH holdings.”
* **Spot trading**
  * “Buy $200 of HYPE.”
  * “Sell 25% of my ETH.”
* **Perp trading**
  * “Open a 3x long on BTC with $500 collateral.”
  * “Close half of my SOL perp.”
  * “Set a stop loss at $2,300 for my ETH long.”
* **Bridging**
  * “Bridge 1 ETH from Ethereum into Hyperliquid.”
  * “Withdraw 0.05 BTC from Hyperliquid to my Bitcoin wallet.”
* **Strategy prompts**
  * “What’s a low-risk way to trade AVAX perps today?”
  * “Backtest a simple SOL long strategy over the last 30 days.”

#### Quickstart Example

1.  You type:

    > “Open a 5x BTC long with $200 if funding rates are below 0.01%.”
2. The agent confirms details, runs the funding rate check, and shows you a preview.
3.  You reply:

    > “Yes, execute it.”
4. The agent executes the trade, waits for confirmation, and reports back the results.

✅ In one conversation, you’ve completed a conditional leveraged trade that would normally take multiple steps across different dashboards.
