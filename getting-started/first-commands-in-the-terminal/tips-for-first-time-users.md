# Tips for First-Time Users

* **Start small** → Try low amounts until you’re comfortable with how prompts work.
* **Be specific** → Commands like “buy ETH” work, but adding details (amount, collateral, leverage) makes results clearer.
* **Use natural language** → You don’t need to know special syntax. Just write as if you’re chatting with a person.
* **Double-check previews** → Your agent always shows a confirmation before executing. Review carefully.
* **Bridge carefully** → Always confirm destination chain and amount before bridging.
* **Stay secure** → Protect your Privy login and associated social account. Treat Hyperrun as a hot wallet, not long-term storage.
