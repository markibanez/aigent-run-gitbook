# Account Setup

When you create an account on aigent.run, everything you need to interact with the terminal is set up for you automatically. You donâ€™t need to worry about complex blockchain steps, your account handles it in the background.

Youâ€™ll have **three flexible options** for how transactions are managed:

1. **Default account (auto-wallet in the background)**
   * A secure aigent.run platform wallet is created automatically when you sign up.
   * This lets you start using the terminal right away with no setup.
   * Perfect if youâ€™re new to blockchain and just want a seamless experience.
2. **Link an external wallet (Xaman, Joey, etc.)**
   * Advanced users can link an external XRPL wallet.
   * Every transaction is signed through your external wallet app, giving you full control (human-in-the-loop agent flow)
   * Ideal if you prefer to keep assets in your own custody.
3. **Agent-managed wallet (hands-off mode)**
   * You can deposit funds into your agentâ€™s wallet.
   * Your agent will execute transactions completely autonomously, no need for you to approve transaction step.
   * Best for users who want their agent to run strategies, trade, or automate tasks without constant input.

> ğŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can switch between these options at any time depending on your needs.
