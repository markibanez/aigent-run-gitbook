# First Commands in the Terminal

After account creation, you can immediately chat with your agent.

Examples:

* “Check my _x_ wallet balance.”
* “Analyze liquidity for _x_ token.”
* “Buy _x_ token using $50 of XRP from my _x_ wallet”
* “What were the biggest transactions using _x_ token today?”

Your agent selects the right tools, executes the request, and shows you the result.

***

### **Quickstart Example**

1. You type:\
   &#xNAN;**"Either, buy aixrp using $50 of XRP and 50 RLUSD if the price has gone down by 20% or less in the last 7 days, or buy aixrp using $100 worth of XRP and 100 RLUSD if the price has gone down by 20% or more in the last 7 days, using my Joey** **wallet"**
2. The agent confirms details, shows a preview, and asks for approval.
3. You reply: **“Yes, buy it.”**
4. The agent prepares the transaction, pushes the transaction to my Joey wallet, awaits transaction success and the provides confirmation message + details when finalized.

> In a single chat, you’ve purchased tokens using a DCA strategy that would normally take dozens of clicks in a traditional DEX.
